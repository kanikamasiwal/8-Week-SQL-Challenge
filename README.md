# 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny: Repository for Solutions and Findings

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the 8 Week SQL Challenge created by Danny Ma. This repository contains my solutions, findings, and reflections as I progress through each week's challenge.

## What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is a series of SQL tasks designed to help SQL enthusiasts improve their skills progressively. Each week presents a new challenge that builds upon the concepts learned in previous weeks.

## Structure of this Repository
Week X: Each week's challenge is organized into its own directory (Week1, Week2, etc.).
README.md: Detailed explanation of the challenge requirements.
Solution.sql: SQL script containing my solution to the challenge.
Findings.md: Document summarizing my approach, insights gained, and any observations from completing the challenge.

## Why I'm Doing This
I created this repository to document my learning journey and share my solutions with the community. By publicly sharing my work, I hope to receive feedback, learn from others, and contribute to the SQL learning community.
